# Canvas explorations

This project explores the Canvas API using ClojureScript, Reagent and Reframe. I read a local `.edn` file containing informations about shapes (for now only circles and rects) and render them into a canvas object.


## Getting started

- Install dependencies

I use Yarn, but you can follow the same instructions using NPM.

```
yarn install
```
- Build and run the project in development mode
```
yarn dev
```
  Navigate to `http://localhost:3000`
